Anything can be considered as artificial intelligence if it involves a program doing something that we would normally rely on our intelligence.\nStwmonica: And here to talk about the advantages of artificial intelligence, the one of the biggest advantages is that it reduces human error. Human error is one of humans make mistakes, mistakes like usually and it happens all the time. So computers however do not make all these mistakes. With artificial intelligence the decisions are taken but they previously gathered information and it uses a set of algorithms. So errors are reduced and chances of reaching accuracy is high.\nSthross: Yes, I am going to agree with you but isn't this a making the human so lazy with its applications?",

So like if humans get addicted to this type of inventions, this might cause a lot of problem to the future generations. Like they might become so lazy.\nSforachel: need not making people lazy. Instead people will be still working on their creativity part. for the decisions where they have to think and make something, people will be working on that. Whereas for the jobs which are repetitive like sending mail and making documents. And in the documents where the errors should be reduced. For those particular things the robots or the AI machines will be working. This will reduce people from working on their boring parts and instead use their mind and energy on the creative parts.\nSfichandler: Yeah, I see I said but I think for the repetitive jobs and the boring jobs you are talking about.",

So for these repetitive jobs, I don't think you need to put this much price and you need to get a robot to do these silly jobs.\nStwmonica: Yes, I agree but it's a one -time investment. So this is considered because artificial intelligence is available for humans, customers or any one. Like for more than 24 hours like 24\nSthross: only it is available 24 by seven but isn't this availability making a cause of unemployment? Like if this AI is replacing the majority of this repetitive tasks. So this might cause a lot of unemployment. Like every organization is looking to replace the minimum qualified individuals with the error of what it means. This will cause a lot of unemployment in the future.",

So if the unemployment will be caused in this sector, it will be created in some other sectors. The employment will be created in some other sector. And along with that, for the jobs with the risk involved, where the human life is at risk. We can make machines do those tasks. Like in fire extinguishing work or in any natural disaster or human disaster. In those cases instead if a human will do the work, there is a risk of their lives. Where the machine works, there are more accuracy, more efficiency and the risk is less.\nSfichandler: As I see, but what I think is these robots are pre -programmed.

So organized organizations have a customer support team. So they work all the time and at any time humans take the help and it's useful.\nSthross: only it is available in digital assistance. But this unit has one thing is that machines can't alter their responses to changing environments. So like that is the basic premise on which these AI are built.

But for the task which are predefined, like we can tell the machine that this is right and this is wrong. For those particular tasks, the decision making by the robots will be faster and will be more efficient. Like the error will be less in those decisions and there will be faster. So this will reduce human efforts along with that it will increase their efficiency of that particular task.\nSfichandler: As a sheep, but I think even in that task, like the old task, that's which you are talking about there.

Those were some nice points as we have seen these have these are some advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence. As we know every new invention or breakthrough will have both advantages and disadvantages. It is upon us how we use it.
